        <p>
        My name is Taylor White and I am from Whittier, California. I joined the Army at 18 in 2008 and got out in 2016 and moved to Florida. I have been working as a Network Engineer and now want to be a Software Engineer. My hobbies include playing video games(Kingdom Hearts is the greatest!), making small video games, watching anime, and outdoorsy stuff. My goals are to eventually be a game developer and then to open my own non-profit to teach under-privileged children how to code and make video games, so that they can have a valuable skill.
